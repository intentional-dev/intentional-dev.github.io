The idea behind applied intentionality is to capture the purpose and behavior of an application in code, and to do this in such a way that everybody involved in the application's development can agree on its [_intentional stance_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intentional_stance):

> Here is how it works: first you decide to treat the object whose behavior is to be predicted as a rational agent; then you figure out what beliefs that agent ought to have, given its place in the world and its purpose. Then you figure out what desires it ought to have, on the same considerations, and finally you predict that this rational agent will act to further its goals in the light of its beliefs. A little practical reasoning from the chosen set of beliefs and desires will in most instances yield a decision about what the agent ought to do; that is what you predict the agent will do.

Now, replace words such as desires and beliefs with _semantic markers_ and we have a working model of applied intentionality.

This site is broadly divided into three areas of research:

1. The patterns and syntax of applied intentionality (Ai).
2. Methodologies based on the notion of Ai as _agreement_.
3. Extending Ai semantic markers into the realm of AI and augmented development.
